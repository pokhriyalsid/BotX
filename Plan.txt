-> Create a script bot which will login to all device periodically to capture output of few commands like show interface status, show process cpu history

->  Run commands to custom group of devices like vlan 101...  or some other command

-> which can also check the changes to the device config compared to last config downloaded, can also send mails based on alert

-> Backup the Device config

-> Check all the subnet's in the network by checking interface config

-> Also can check cdp/LLDP neighbor or interface descrption for firewall ( or need to check how to find the Firewall)




************************************************************************************
************************************************************************************
Function : 1
-> Login to device and copy the Run config and also find out the changes made compared to last output and Email the changes
-> This Script should also be able to collect the output of few commands mentioned in a text file and will verify the change
show cdp nei
show interface status
ping 8.8.8.8
-> There should be option to add/modify the commands

Function : 2
-> Login to all devices and checks which Vlan, ip address subnets are behind them

Function : 3
-> Script to run a single command or set of cmds on many devices
-> This script will also verify post changes output and should be able to rollback if all/few changes . Use EEM script for this.

Function : 4
-> This function should be able to modify the commands we want to run or change list of Devices

*************************************************************************************
Implementation work flow
*************************************************************************************
-> Script would run in the background based on cron job scheduled
-> Manually run the script for functions like function 2,3,4
-> When Script is manually started , at first it should be able to give us options regarding what to do
-> Based on our input as per the above step it will invoke the necessary script
-> So idea is to design individual scripts for all the functions
